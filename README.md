# Big Data Analytics

## Introduction

This repository contains two distinct but insightful data analysis projects, showcasing the application of data science techniques to real-world business challenges. Each project employs advanced analytics, data visualization, and predictive modeling to derive actionable insights.

### 1. **Sales System Impact Analysis** (`Project 1 Final.ipynb`)

This project evaluates the impact of a newly implemented sales tracking system introduced in 2023. It answers a critical business question:
- **Impact Evaluation**: Assessing whether the adoption of the new system has significantly improved sales and profits.
- **Data Integration**: Combining and preprocessing datasets to enable a holistic analysis.
- **Visualization and Insights**: Comparing trends before and after the system implementation through detailed visualizations.

This notebook highlights how data-driven insights can validate strategic business decisions and inform future strategies.

### 2. **Staples Sales Analytics Report** (`Jeffrey_Fernandez_Raghav_Thondikulam_Practice3_Final.ipynb`)

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sales and profits for the final quarter (Q4) of 2024. The report addresses the following key objectives:
- **Sales and Profit Prediction**: Utilizing machine learning techniques, such as Linear Regression, to forecast total sales and profits.
- **Data Exploration**: Cleaning and analyzing datasets to identify key trends and insights.
- **Visualization**: Leveraging libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to present findings visually.

This notebook demonstrates a comprehensive workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to predictive modeling, making it a valuable resource for business forecasting.
